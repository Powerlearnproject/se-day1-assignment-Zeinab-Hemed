#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is a branch of computer science used for developing, testing and maintaining software.
It's importance is as follows;
Scalability- it ensures that a system can handle a wide load without affecting perfomance.
Reliability- it ensures that the system performs well without any problem.
Security- It provides authorization and encryption to protect user information.
efficiency - it helps to optimize developer workflow while maintaining high quality standards.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1. Mastering Complexity
Early software development was informal, and as programs grew in size, complexity became a major challenge.
The structured programming movement (1960s-1970s) introduced modular design, breaking large programs into smaller, manageable parts (e.g., using functions and procedures).
The rise of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in the 1980s further helped manage complexity by organizing code into reusable objects with defined behaviors.
2. Mastering Process
As software projects expanded, developers needed systematic approaches to ensure reliability and efficiency.
The Waterfall Model (1970s) formalized step-by-step development (requirements, design, coding, testing, maintenance).
The Agile Manifesto (2001) introduced iterative development, emphasizing flexibility, collaboration, and continuous improvement.
DevOps (2010s) further streamlined software processes by integrating development and operations for faster and more reliable releases.
3. Mastering Machine
Software engineering has evolved alongside hardware advancements, requiring developers to optimize performance across different machines.
Early programming languages like Assembly required direct interaction with hardware, but high-level languages (e.g., C, Java, Python) improved efficiency and portability.
Modern software leverages cloud computing, AI, and distributed systems, allowing for scalable and high-performance applications.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1. Planning
Defines project goals, scope, feasibility, resources, and risks.
Helps ensure the project aligns with business objectives and is achievable.
2. Requirement Analysis
Gathers and documents user and system requirements.
Ensures a clear understanding of what the software must do.
3. Design
Creates software architecture, database design, and user interface.
Includes high-level (system architecture) and low-level (detailed module) designs.
4. Implementation (Coding & Development)
Developers write and compile the actual source code.
Uses programming languages, frameworks, and tools based on design specifications.
5. Testing
Identifies and fixes bugs through various testing methods (unit, integration, system, and user acceptance testing).
Ensures the software functions correctly and meets requirements.
6. Deployment
Releases the software for users, either in a test (beta) or production environment.
Can involve installation, cloud deployment, or distribution via app stores.
7. Maintenance & Support
Fixes issues, updates software for improvements, and ensures security.
Adapts to user feedback and changing requirements.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

1. The waterfall uses linear and sequential approach while agile methodolgy uses iterative and incremental approach.
2. The waterfall delivers one end product at the end of the cycle while agile methodology delivers in small and functional increments.
3. The waterfall has minimal user involvement after the requirements phase while agile has continous user involvement through feeback loops.
4. The flexibility of the waterfall methodology is rigid hence making it difficult to make changes once a phase is completed while agile methodology is highly flexible and allows changes throughout development.
5. Waterfall methodology is best for projects with well defined requirements while agile methodology is best for projects where requirements may evolve.
Scenarios Where Each is Appropriate
1. Waterfall is appropriate for:
Government or military projects where requirements are fixed and changes are costly.
Banking and financial software where security and compliance require detailed documentation.
Construction and manufacturing systems where structured development is necessary.
2. Agile is appropriate for:
Software startups that need rapid iteration and user feedback (e.g., mobile apps, web platforms).
E-commerce and SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) platforms that require frequent updates.
AI and machine learning projects, where data and requirements may evolve.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

1. A Software Developer is responsible for designing, coding, and maintaining software applications.
2. Ensures the software meets quality standards before release.
3. Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of a software project.
4. Designs the overall structure and framework of the software system.
5. Ensures that the software is visually appealing and user-friendly.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Importance of IDEs:
1.Efficient Coding – Syntax highlighting, code completion, and auto-suggestions help developers write code faster and with fewer errors.
2.Debugging Tools – Built-in debuggers help identify and fix issues efficiently.
3.Code Navigation & Refactoring – Allows easy navigation through large codebases and facilitates safe refactoring.
4.Integration with VCS & Build Tools – Supports Git, CI/CD pipelines, and package managers for seamless development.
5.Multi-language Support – Enables development in various programming languages within the same environment.
Examples of IDEs include; X-code,eclipse,visual studio code and pycharm
Importance of VCS:
1.Collaboration – Enables multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously without conflicts.
2.Change Tracking – Maintains a history of changes, making it easier to understand who modified what and why.
3.Branching & Merging – Supports creating separate branches for new features, testing, or bug fixes before merging them into the main codebase.
4.Code Backup & Recovery – Prevents data loss by storing code versions in a centralized repository.
5.Continuous Integration & Deployment (CI/CD) – Automates testing and deployment for faster software releases.
Examples of VCS include; git and subversions.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

1. Security Concerns and Data Protection- Security threats like cyberattacks, data breaches, and vulnerabilities pose risks to software applications. Best strategy for this problem is through Conducting regular security audits and penetration testing.
2. Meeting Tight Deadlines- Project deadlines can be strict, leading to stress, long working hours, and potential burnout. This can be overcomed through Communicating realistic expectations with managers and stakeholders.
3. Rapidly Changing Technologies- The tech industry evolves quickly, with new frameworks, languages, and tools emerging frequently. This can be overcomed through Engaging in open-source projects to gain hands-on experience with new technologies.
4. Managing Complexity in Large Codebases- As software projects grow, the codebase becomes more complex, making it harder to maintain, debug, and scale. This can be overcomed through  Using code reviews to ensure quality and consistency.
5. Collaboration and Team Communication- Working in a team requires clear communication, but misunderstandings and misalignment of goals can occur. This can be solved through Actively listen and providing constructive feedback to teammates.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

1.System testing -Focus on the entire software system as a whole, including all functionalities and interactions.
 -It help to verify that the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements, including performance, usability, and security .
 2. Unit Testing- Unit testing focuses on testing individual components (or units) of code, typically functions or methods, in isolation.
 -Ensures that each unit functions correctly before integration, Catches bugs early in development reducing the cost of fixing them later and Improves code quality and maintainability.
 3. Integration Testing- verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together.
 - help to ensure data flows smoothly between modules and interfaces work as expected.
4. Acceptance Testing- Acceptance testing determines whether the software meets business needs and is ready for deployment.
   - Confirms the software works as expected from the end-user perspective, Helps detect usability issues before launch and Ensures that the system meets client and business requirements.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and refining input prompts to optimize the performance of AI models.

1.  Enhances AI Output Quality
Well-structured prompts ensure precise and contextually appropriate responses.
2. Helps Overcome AI Limitations
AI models may struggle with vague or overly broad queries.
3. Enables Task-Specific Customization
Different prompts can be designed for various use cases.
4.  Improves Efficiency & Saves Time
A properly engineered prompt reduces the need for follow-up clarifications.
5.  Enhances AI-Powered Automation
Many industries rely on AI to generate reports, analyze trends, and assist in customer support.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt:
Draw a cat.

Improved Prompt:
Draw a fluffy white cat with blue eyes sitting on a windowsill, looking outside at a snowy landscape. The window has frost on the edges, and a warm light is coming from inside the room.

Why is the improved prompt better?
Clarity – Specifies the cat's color (white), eye color (blue), and position (on a windowsill).
Specific Details – Describes the scene (snowy landscape, frosted window, warm indoor light), making the image more vivid.
Concise – Gives clear guidance without unnecessary complexity.
